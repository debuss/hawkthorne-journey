# Introduction

This project is a fork of the official [Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey) game project.  
The purpose of this fork is to make the game compatible for the latest version of LÖVE (currently 11.x).

_I modified the Makefile to make it point to my love binary path, do not forget to change it as well for your setup._

Below this paragraph is an extract from the original project README.  
For more information, please check out the [original project](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey).

# Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne

This 2d platformer is based on Community's [Digital Estate Planning][estate]
episode. It's built using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine. Please
